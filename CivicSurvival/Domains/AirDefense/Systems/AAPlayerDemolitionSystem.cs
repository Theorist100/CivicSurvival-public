    /// Pause-safe player-demolition handler for AA installations.
    ///
    /// When the player bulldozes an AA prop with the vanilla bulldozer, the tool applies in a
    /// pause-safe phase (vanilla deletes the prop immediately, even on pause) and the
    /// installation sidecar's Building ref goes stale. This system runs in ModificationEnd —
    /// which ticks every frame even while paused, mirroring both vanilla's own bulldoze-refund
    /// phase and our pause-safe AA PLACEMENT — so it detects the stale ref the same frame and:
    ///   - returns the FULL crew (no casualties — the player chose to remove it);
    ///   - refunds the decaying buyer's-remorse fraction of the paid budget, credited
    ///     SYNCHRONOUSLY via CityBudgetService.AddFunds (the same pause-safe path AA placement
    ///     uses to deduct) — a deferred budget request would not resolve until GameSimulation
    ///     ran again, i.e. only after unpause, which is exactly the bug this replaces;
    ///   - records the UI-stats removal and tags the sidecar Deleted.
    ///
    /// Combat loss is NOT handled here — that stays in AACrewReleaseSystem (GameSimulation),
    /// driven by DestroyedBuildingEvent with a survivor/KIA split and no refund (combat only
    /// happens unpaused).
    ///
    /// COMBAT vs DEMOLITION is classified by an orthogonal vanilla signal, not by timing.
    /// Decompile-verified (CS2): the two removal routes are separated by both component and
    /// phase, so they can never be confused:
    ///   - COMBAT destruction routes through Game.Objects.DestroySystem, which runs in
    ///     GameSimulation (pause-gated) and stamps Destroyed on the building (it lingers as
    ///     rubble for frames before any Deleted). That is AACrewReleaseSystem's territory.
    ///   - PLAYER bulldoze routes through the tool pipeline — BulldozeToolSystem (ToolUpdate)
    ///     emits a Delete definition, OriginalDeletedSystem (PreTool) stamps Deleted on the
    ///     original WITHOUT Destroyed. Those tool phases are pumped by ToolSystem from MainLoop,
    ///     outside the SimulationSystem pause gate, which is exactly why a bulldoze applies on
    ///     pause — and why this system lives in the equally pause-safe ModificationEnd.
    /// So a Destroyed building is, by construction, a combat loss the bulldozer cannot produce.
    /// We skip it below and let the combat path be its single owner. That makes both paths
    /// race-free at the signal level: even in the narrow Destroyed+Deleted window neither path
    /// double-processes the same installation (no full-crew + wrong refund here, no KIA split
    /// there). The Deleted tag this system applies tags the demolished AA before any later pass.

            // the schedule: it guarantees its reaction systems run before the cleanup pass recycles
            // the Deleted entity, in a known phase, with the one-frame transient tag still alive. A
            // mod does NOT own that order — our position relative to vanilla's Deleted-cleanup, and

            // good, the entity is already gone) or collide with another mod — the cross-mod crash
            // this project already hit when reacting to entity deletion.
            //

            // frame the bulldoze landed in, and we never delete or race vanilla / other mods (we
